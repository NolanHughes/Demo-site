              I’ve been actively using Git for about 2 years now, but never took the time to learn some of the more advanced, albeit common, commands.

            <p>For part 2 of my <code class="inline-code">Promises</code> series I thought it’d be a good idea to go over error propagation. The main takeaways are using <code class="inline-code">.catch</code> and try and catch with <code class="inline-code">aysnc/await</code>.</p>

            <h3 class="post-heading"><a href="blog-posts/promises.html">Promises - Part 1</a></h3>
            <p>Last week I went over the keywords async and await and thought it might be a good idea to touch on Promises a little bit since they are directly tied with those keywords. Since this is a fairly involved topic I'm going to split it into multiple parts. This first part will essentially be a general overview.</p>

            <h3 class="post-heading"><a href="blog-posts/async_await.html">Async Await</a></h3>
            <p>Today I wanted to talk about async/await in JavaScript. They are syntactic sugar in JavaScript that help organize and keep our asynchronous code concise. Before this addition to the language, the usual way of dealing with asynchronous code was by using a <code class="inline-code">.then</code> chain.</p>

            <p>I’m currently working on a React project to help with managing tasks for the law office where I work. I was thinking about just using local component state for the whole project, but the more I get into it, the more I am starting to think that I’ll need to use Redux.</p>

            <p>One of my biggest worries after graduating from a bootcamp like Flatiron’s (besides actually landing a job) is how I should be continuing to improve my programming skills.</p>

            <p>What can I say? I love React! It’s been a great experience working through the React curriculum in Flatiron’s course and spending loads of hours (probably too many) on my final project.</p>

            <h3 class="post-heading"><a href="blog-posts/rails_js_app.html">Beer Recipe App with JavaScript</a></h3>
            <p>So the latest project I’ve completed is actually an extension of my previous Rails project. It incorporates all of the goodness that is JavaScript into my recipe app for documenting homebrewed beer recipes. Since I feel like I added about a thousand new features, I’m going to focus on only one feature/topic in this post so that I’m able to go deeper in explaining how it works and not just give another overview of the app. The topic I’ll be covering today is page specific JavaScript!</p>

              <p>I built this web app using Rails and it is all about making beer recipes for home brewing. It allows users who create an account to make a recipe and view all of the other recipes that other users have created.</p>

              <p>It’s been awhile since I last posted a blog but I’m determined to do these on a more consistent basis. I have been so focused on completing course work and learning that I haven’t wanted to put the time into extracurricular activities that I know will lead to strengthening my overall education. Even if that means slowing down my progress with Flatiron a bit.</p>

              <p>This was definitely a tough project. There’s no question about that! It gives you more free range than any of the labs up until this point, but that doesn’t necessarily make it any easier.</p>
